Hello! This is my 3d physics engine that I developed using C++
It uses Verlet integration to simulate the physics of objects. It also uses the SFML library to render the objects.
I'm planning to use this engine to create a game in the future.
```
Currently it only compiles on MacOS, but I'm planning to make it cross-platform in the future. But for the time being, if you want to try it out, you can download the source and build files from this repo.
```
Here's a demo video:
